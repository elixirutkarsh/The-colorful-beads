# The-colorful-beads
You have 15 beads in a row, each with a different color. You want to rearrange the beads in such a way that no two beads of the same color are adjacent to each other. How many different arrangements are possible?

Solution 1: There are two possible arrangements. Let's represent the colors as numbers (1 to 15) for simplicity. One arrangement could be: 1-2-1-3-1-4-1-5-1-6-1-7-1-8-1. Another possible arrangement could be: 2-1-3-1-4-1-5-1-6-1-7-1-8-1-9. Any other arrangement will have adjacent beads of the same color.
